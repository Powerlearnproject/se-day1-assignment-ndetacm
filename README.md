Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering  is a discipline that systematically applies engineering principle, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.
It's importance in the technology industry is enabling the creation of software application and systems.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages
Advent of structured programmes in the 1970s
Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements- gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
Design- Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation- Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing-Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment-releasing software to consumers
Maintenance-: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is the sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards, software development life cycle (SDLC)  while Agile methodologies use an iterative and incremental approach focusing on flexibility, collaboration and responding to changes 
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- writes and create codes  and implements software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer-executes tests plans to ensure software quality
Project manager-oversees the planning, execution and delivery of softwares
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide tools for writing, debugging and testing codes
VCS provides tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
some of the common challenges include; changing requirements, tight deadlines and technical debt 
strategies to overcome them include; communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of work, regular reassesment of project goals and timelines
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit test- test individual components or modules of a software
integration test-test interactions between different components or software subsystems
system test-test the entire software system as a whole
acceptance test- test  the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering- the process of providing AI with context or statements to guide its actions or responses
its main importance is that helps avoid vagueness by providing AI with clear and specific questions so that it can understand exactly what we need
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague; "tell me about biotechnology"
improved prompt "Assuming you are a career path advisor, can you help a high school graduate know more about biotechology; what it is, it's types, fields they can dive to and a career path they can take" 
the improved prompt is way effective as it give us more , clear and concise information we need
